NoSQL queries done during course DATA.DB.300 Database Systems: NoSQL.
Each week's exercises are in their own files, I've only written the ones in <exercise_number>/app/todos/your_code,
the rest are helper functions and ready-made code by teaching staff.

Ex01a and ex01b include queries done with MondoDB in Python.
Ex02a and ex02b include queries done with Neo4j in Python.
Ex03 includes queries to a LLM done with Neo4j in Python.
